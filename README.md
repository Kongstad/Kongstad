# Peter Kongstad

Remote Sensing Specialist and Geospatial Data Engineer at Agreena. I design and build production systems that process satellite data at scale, integrating multi-sensor observations with ground truth to deliver monitoring products for agriculture.

Most of my professional work lives in private repositories. I'm building portfolio projects here to demonstrate similar technical capabilities using public data.

## Technical Stack

**Infrastructure & Engineering**
STAC, PySTAC, odc-stac, FastAPI, AWS (S3, EC2), Ray Anyscale, Docker, Python

**Remote Sensing & Analysis**
Sentinel-1/2, Landsat, MODIS, LiDAR, land cover/land use data, deforestation datasets, water/hydrology data, xarray, rasterio, GDAL

**Machine Learning & AI**
PyTorch, scikit-learn

## Portfolio Projects

### Soon available for public release
Building open-source projects demonstrating production geospatial engineering:

- STAC API implementation for satellite data access
- React-based satellite imagery visualization
- Multi-temporal NDVI analysis with statistical methods
- Land cover classification using machine learning
- LiDAR-derived terrain and hydrological analysis
- Kubernetes and Terraform infrastructure

## Professional Background

MSc Geoscience from University of Copenhagen. Three years developing satellite data infrastructure, MRV systems, and agricultural monitoring products at Agreena.

Work includes STAC-native platforms, rotation-bias-corrected productivity analysis, multi-modal analysis pipelines, and LLM-powered agricultural insights.
