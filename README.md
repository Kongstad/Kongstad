# Peter Kongstad

Remote Sensing Specialist and Geospatial Data Engineer at Agreena. I design and build production systems that process satellite data at scale, integrating multi-sensor observations with ground truth to deliver monitoring products for agriculture.

Most of my professional work lives in private repositories. I'm building portfolio projects here to demonstrate similar technical capabilities using public data.

## Technical Stack

**Infrastructure & Engineering**
STAC, PySTAC, odc-stac, FastAPI, AWS (S3, EC2), Ray Anyscale, Docker, Python

**Remote Sensing & Analysis**
Sentinel-1/2, Landsat, MODIS, LiDAR, land cover/land use data, deforestation datasets, water/hydrology data, xarray, rasterio, GDAL

**Machine Learning & AI**
PyTorch, scikit-learn

## Portfolio Projects

### Released

- **[sat-data-acquisition](https://github.com/Kongstad/sat-data-acquisition)** - Lightweight Python package for downloading satellite imagery from multiple STAC sources with a standardized API (Available on PyPI)

### In Development

Building open-source projects demonstrating production geospatial engineering:

- React-based satellite imagery visualization
- Multi-temporal NDVI analysis with statistical methods
- Land cover classification using machine learning
- LiDAR-derived terrain and hydrological analysis
- Kubernetes and Terraform infrastructure

## Professional Background
